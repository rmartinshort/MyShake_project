# MyShake_project

Research project that aims to make use of seismic data recorded on phones by the MyShake app  
The general aim is as follows:  
- Trigger groups of phones in some urban area to start recording for short intervals. If we keep switching the 
groups of phones, we can attempt to get semi-continuous recording in the area if it is densely populated  
- Obtain the data. We can use it to build maps of urban noise in a region  
- Eventually, we will aim to impliment a small event detection algorithm similar to that described by Inbal et al. (2018)  

This is a continuation of work carried out by A. Inbal while he was a postdoc at the Berkeley Seismic Lab.  


### This repo contains active research code

A (hopefully updated) contents is as follows   

-- Triggering_experiment: Code to trigger groups of phones automatically over some defined period. The aim of this exeriment was to test the triggering system by triggering phones and the investigating how many of the phones we selected to activate actually got turned on. The .ipynb contains some plots and exploration to that effect.
